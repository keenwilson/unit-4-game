# Harry Potter RPG
A web-based jQuery game of which theme has been adapted from *Star Wars RPG* to *Harry Potter RPG*.

## How the app works

* When game starts, there will be four characters on screen. You can pick *your main character* to fight by clicking on the character's picture. You will fight as that character for the rest of the game.

* The remainders will become enemies that you have to defeat. You choose *an opponent* by clicking on an enemy's picture.

* The goal of the game is to **defeat all the enemies by fighting them**. 
    *When we fight them, your goal is to reduce their HP (hit points) to *zero or below*.
    *At any point if your HP is reduced to *zero or below*, you lose.
