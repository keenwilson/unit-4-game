# Harry Potter RPG

A web-based jQuery role-playing game (RPG) where the user can control a fictional character from *Harry Potter*.

This  game utilizes jQuery to show the user player choices, and let the user pick their player and another player to fight. The user can attack their enemy, and their enemy attacks in return. When health is zero or below for either player, the other player wins.

## How the app works

* When game starts, there will be four characters on screen. You can pick *your main character* to fight by clicking on the character's picture. You will fight as that character for the rest of the game.

* The remainders will become enemies that you have to defeat. You choose *an opponent* by clicking on an enemy's picture.

* The goal of the game is to **defeat all the enemies by fighting them**. 
    *When we fight them, your goal is to reduce their HP (hit points) to *zero or below*.
    *At any point if your HP is reduced to *zero or below*, you lose.
